### TextSorter Assignment

 I have been assigned to create a program in my course datastructures and algorithms, that reads a file and sorts it based on sanitized words consisting exclusively from characters in the latin alphabet in an lexicographical order. The repo should include Shakespeares completed works to demo the algorithms. The sorting should be implemented with following sorting algorithms:

- [x] Selection Sort
- [x] Insertion Sort
- [x] Heap Sort
- [x] Merge Sort
- [x] Sorting using a Trie

##### Time measuring should be included in the implementation, to compare the time complexities of the individual algorithms.

Using Shakespeares complete works the algorithms ran in the times below:
- SelectionSort - > 2 hours
- InsertionSort - > 2 hours
- Heap Sort     - ~1800ms
- Merge Sort    - ~800ms
- Trie Sort     - ~500ms (Quite proud of this one, it doesn't resemble popular implementations and I find it very logical )
