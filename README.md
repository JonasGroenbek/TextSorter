### TextSorter

 I have been assigned to create a program in my course datastructures and algorithms, that reads a file and sorts it based on sanitized words consisting exclusively of latin alphabetic characters in an alphabetic order. The sorting should be implemented with following sorting algorithms:

- [x] Selection Sort
- [x] Insertion Sort
- [x] Heap Sort
- [x] Merge Sort
- [ ] Sorting using a Trie

##### A time measuring should be included in the implementation, to compare the time complexities of the individual algorithms.
