### TextSorter Assignment

 I have been assigned to create a program in my course datastructures and algorithms, that reads a file and sorts it based on sanitized words consisting exclusively of latin alphabetic characters in an alphabetic order. The repo should include Shakespeares completed works to illustrate the algorithms and sorting should be implemented with following sorting algorithms:

- [x] Selection Sort
- [x] Insertion Sort
- [x] Heap Sort
- [x] Merge Sort
- [ ] Sorting using a Trie

##### Time measuring should be included in the implementation, to compare the time complexities of the individual algorithms.
